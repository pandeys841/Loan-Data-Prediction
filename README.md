# Loan-Data-Prediction
Project Details
This is a Loan data related project where I had historical Data of various customer with target variable of loan default. I had to build a model to predict whether customer should we given loan or not based on his historical data.

Approach
I pre-processed the historical loan data. Then I divided train data into model and validation data. First initialised a simple logistic regression model on model data and predicted on validation data but did not get desired score. Then I tried random forest classifier model where scores improved. I further tried to improve scores by hyper parameter tuning and in the end got a better model.
